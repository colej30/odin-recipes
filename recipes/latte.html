    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>An Americano is a simple yet elegant coffee drink made by diluting a shot of espresso with hot water. It's known
        for its clean, straightforward flavor that showcases the characteristics of the espresso while being less
        intense than a straight shot.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>**Espresso:** A freshly pulled shot of espresso.</li>
        <li>**Hot Water:** The amount of water is typically 2-3 times the volume of the espresso shot.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>**Pull a shot of espresso.** Follow the steps for making a shot of espresso and pour it into a mug or cup.
        </li>
        <li>**Heat the water.** Heat the water to just below boiling, typically around 195-205°F (90-96°C).</li>
