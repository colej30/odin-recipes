    <h5>Americano</h5>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>An Americano is a simple yet elegant coffee drink made by diluting a shot of espresso with hot water. It's known
        for its clean, straightforward flavor that showcases the characteristics of the espresso while being less
        intense than a straight shot.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>**Finely Ground Coffee Beans:** The quality and grind size of the coffee are crucial.</li>
        <li>**Hot Water:** Heated to the optimal brewing temperature (typically 195-205°F or 90-96°C).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>**Grind the coffee.** Use a high-quality grinder to get a very fine, consistent grind. The size of the
            particles is critical for proper extraction.</li>
        <li>**Dose and Tamp the coffee.** Measure the correct amount of grounds into the portafilter basket. Then, use a
            tamper to apply firm, even pressure to create a flat, compacted "puck."</li>
        <li>**Pull the shot.** Place the portafilter into the espresso machine's group head and start the extraction.
            The machine forces hot water through the coffee grounds under high pressure, and the espresso should pour
            out in a steady, dark stream, becoming a golden-brown liquid with a rich crema on top.</li>
    </ol>
